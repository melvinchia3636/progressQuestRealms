<p align="center">A GUI application that shows you complete rank list of realms in Progress Quest</p>

## The Problem

I've been playing a game called [Progress Quest](https://progressquest.com) for a while, and everytime I have to open my browser, type the link, navigate through pages just to check my rank. A bit inconvinient don't you think?

## The Solution

So yeah, let's make a desktop app for it.
